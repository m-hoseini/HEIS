To see whether this policy help improving the living condition of lower income households or not we compare the monthly trend of share of food expenditure in 1397 and 1398. As food is neccesary for housholds its share in total expenditure is a simple measure of poverty. The below code and its output shows that prior to Aban the food share in 1398 was higher than 1397, suggesting worse living condition in 1398. But after Aban the share declined and in 1398 were lower than 1397, which is most probably due to the gas price reform and its subsequent subsidies. library(tidyverse) monthly &lt;- readRDS(&quot;./exported/HH97.Rds&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(year=&quot;97&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(readRDS(&quot;./exported/HH98.Rds&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(year=replace_na(year,&quot;98&quot;)) %&gt;% group_by(month,year) %&gt;% summarise(across(c(cost_food,expenditure),~sum(.x*weight,na.rm=T))) %&gt;% mutate(foodshare=cost_food/expenditure) %&gt;% filter(month&gt;0) ggplot(monthly,aes(month, foodshare, color = year, shape = year)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + geom_vline(xintercept=8)+ ylab(&quot;share of food in monthly expenditure&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:12) "]]
